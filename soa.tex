\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{cha:intro}

Event detection using social networks is already a common practice. The literature offers many example of global scale event detection based on the analysis of social media contents, such as real-time earthquake identification based on tweets \cite{sakaki2010earthquake}, breaking news discovery in Twitter \cite{jackoway2011identification, phuvipadawat2010breaking}, or big gigs recognition observing the frequency of posts on Flickr \cite{liu2011using}.

Event prediction using social network contents is also pretty common: the most striking example of the last few years is the 2016 american elections. In fact, while many of the official polls made by the most famous american newspapers and televisions had always forecasted Hillary Clinton as winner, social media reactions were increasingly in favor of the Republicans \cite{elections}, and the rest is history. Other cases of event prediction using social media are, for example, movie box-office \cite{asur2010predicting} or Oscars-winner forecasts.

There is much less literature about life-event detection, which will be briefly described in the following section.

\section{Life event detectors}
\label{sec:classifiers}
The core of the literature is focused on life event identification in textual contents taken from social networks. All the models proposed in scientific papers and articles follow a similar pattern. Firstly, a set of life events to search for is fixed(e.g. getting married, birth of a child, buy a new house, etc.), then some data is fetch from social media, analysed or labelled, and finally a machine learning classifier is trained and tested on that data. Each of previous steps is executed in several ways, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data is downloaded following two different philosophies. Some authors prefer to fetch only contents that contain specific keywords (such as "\textit{engagement}" for marriage) \cite{dickinson2015identifying, cavalinclassification, moyanolife, khobarekar2013detecting}, some other search for contents randomly, considering a text related to the life event if it contains at least one keyword \cite{choudhury2014personal, di2013detecting}.
\item Feature estraction is done mainly in two ways - syntax analysis, using bag-of-words or bag-of-N-grams \cite{cavalinclassification, di2013detecting, li2014major} - semantic analysis, such as sentiment, formality with which the text is written, entities and topics contained, etc \cite{khobarekar2013detecting}. In addition to that, some models consider also "external" features, like user's behaviour or post success \cite{dickinson2015identifying}.
\item The majority of models consider only a single post at a time, while \cite{cavalin2015multiple, moyanolife} consider also the reactions and the conversation related to a main post.
\end{itemize}

For our purpose, these cited models have several weaknesses. First of all, they are only classifiers that tell if a post is about or not to a life event, they don't go further on author history. Furthermore, a post related to a life event may not be concerned with the author (e.g. participate to a wedding instead of getting married). In addiction, there is no time reference: a post can be about something in the past, in the present or in the future. Last but not least, all these models are focused only on Twitter, and only on texts.

\section{A step further}
\label{sec:further}
The model described by Cavalin, Gatti, Pinharez \cite{cavalin2014towards} goes a step further to all the previous classificator. In fact, starting from life event detection on a random sample of tweets, it performs a user matching on an existing database of clients, aimed to decide which is the best approach to offer them some services or some products.

In common with our model there is a move forward from a simple classifier, but there is a big difference: Cavalin, Gatti and Pinharez take a wide range of tweets from all over the world to analyse the presence of a life event not considering user's timeline at all, while our model is focused on a single user analysis. Furthermore, this last model is also concentrated only on Twitter contents.

\section{Other interesting methods}
\label{sec:other}
In addition to the previous artefacts, the literature offers several works that are methodologically interesting. They will be briefly described now.

As already mentioned, life event detection is a branch of event identification. The core of the business is therefore the identification of events from a stream of time-stamped documents coming from social networks. In concrete, \cite{vavliakis2013event} organizes documents from various sources according to the event they describe assigning to the event an importance, while \cite{chen2009adaptive} tracks how much activity is related to an event from a global stream of documents. However these two models have an implicit problem: they consider the importance of the event based on the \textit{noise} the event brings with him. The more people talk about an event, the more important it is. Therefore every global event, such as The Olympics, will be classified as much more important than a wedding or a birth of a child.

Another interesting study is \cite{li2014inferring}, which proposes a model-driven system to infer user attitudes or preferences reasoning over user attributes and social network graphs. It builds, for every user, a series of predicates for his/her attributes (location, gender, education), relationships (married, friends) and preferences (what he/she likes/dislikes), which can be used to detect important events on his/her timeline or in friends/relatives social profiles, combining multiple social networks (\texttt{Twitter} and \texttt{Google+}). The only problem is that this model is designed not to deal with life events.

A last study of interest is about topic sentiment analysis using the hashtah graph in Twitter \cite{wang2011topic}. It demonstrates that hashtags offer additional information to texts, classifying tweets and users in categories: the use of a specific hashtag may be connected with a specific life event. This kind of study, however, have more sense on global scale analysis like the proposed one: it may be not so useful in a context of life event detection, which is concentrated on a single-user analysis.
